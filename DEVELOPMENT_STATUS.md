# ‚ö†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT STATUS - NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

## Important Disclaimer

**This application is currently in early development and is NOT ready for production use or public distribution.**

### Current Development Status

This is a work-in-progress forensic evidence documentation app for iOS and macOS platforms. While significant progress has been made on core functionality, **the application is incomplete and requires substantial additional development before it can be considered ready for real-world use**.

### Known Limitations & Missing Features

1. **Testing**: Limited real-world testing has been conducted
2. **Security Audit**: No comprehensive security audit has been performed
3. **Legal Compliance**: Has not been reviewed for legal/forensic standards compliance
4. **Hardware Testing**: Not tested on physical devices extensively
5. **Performance**: No performance optimization for production environments
6. **Documentation**: User documentation and guides are incomplete
7. **Accessibility**: Accessibility features not fully implemented
8. **Localization**: Only English language support currently

### Developer Resource Constraints

The primary developer currently lacks:
- Access to physical iOS devices for comprehensive testing
- Resources for professional security auditing
- Time for extensive real-world validation
- Budget for App Store distribution and certification

### Technical Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Completed Core Components:**
- Cross-platform SwiftUI architecture (iOS/macOS)
- Cryptographic evidence chain implementation
- Local secure storage with encryption
- GitHub integration for cloud backup
- Biometric authentication system
- PDF export functionality
- Comprehensive test suite

üîÑ **In Progress:**
- User interface polish and refinement
- Error handling and edge case coverage
- Performance optimization
- Real-world testing scenarios

‚ùå **Not Yet Implemented:**
- Professional security audit
- Legal compliance verification
- Physical device testing at scale
- Production deployment infrastructure
- User support and documentation system

### Future Development Plans

This project will continue development when resources become available:
- Physical device acquisition for testing
- Security audit funding
- Legal compliance review
- Community feedback integration
- Production deployment preparation
